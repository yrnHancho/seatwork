	<p class="text-info"> The drama centers on Italian mafia consigliere Vincenzo Cassano, who following the death of his boss relocates to Korea. He stays for a while with the intention of finding some hidden gold before leaving.
     When he joins the battle against Babel, a very corrupt organization of businesses, his strategy is derailed. With the aid of Korean attorney Hong Cha-Young, he ultimately ends himself defending and assisting a motley crew of residents of Geumga Plaza.
     In a world where justice does not exist and the law is insufficient, the drama puts evil characters against one another. With a huge ensemble, there is action, thrill, drama, and comedy.</p>
